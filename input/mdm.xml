<!--
Check this:
- the objective-refer info in the threats & assumptions sections is not in the 
  version 3 word document. I had to copy them from the 2.0 github doc  

- for the security objectives (<SOs> tags), I copied the <component-refer> 
   tags from version 2.0, these need to be checked

To do:
- ask Keven about <OSPs> tag, why do I have to wrap each <OSP> with an <OSPs>
- cross references - search for Section & Appendix cross refs & adjust

- edit fau_gen to make it applicable to any component of a distributed toe
- make links out of all the references to ITT/ITC sfr's
- finish table 1, have to add where we think things belong
- fix table 2 after mas server sfr's get figured out
- fix dead links to TLS, etc
- comment matrix
- TLS: package and figure out how to use platform TLS with the TLS package
- Mas server
- incorporate evaluation activity for distributed TOE (SD B.4) (pulled it in the appendix but its ugly and might need to be fixed)
- have to change ftp_itc_ext.1.1 to bring in fpt_itt even if agent is not in the TOE because its needed for distributed
- unify the random use of  TOE/TSF/MDM server and MD user/agent


- Mas server SFR's that were removed: ftp_itc.1(3), ftp_itc.1.3(2), fau_stg_ext.1.1(2) 
- Mas server SFR's that have functionality that needs to be brought in somehow: fau_gen.1(2), fmt_smr.1(2), fmt_mof.1(3), fmt_mof.1(4), fmt_smf.1(3)

    <section id="cte" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
      The Mobile Device Management (MDM) system consists of two primary components: the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server software and the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent. Optionally, the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> system may consist of a separate Mobile Application Store (MAS) server. 
      <subsection id="tb" title="TOE Boundary"> The <abbr linkend="MDM"/> system operational environment consists of the mobile device on which the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent resides, the platform on which the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server runs, and an untrusted wireless network over which they communicate, as pictured below.
        <h:br/><h:br/>
        <figure entity="images/MDMserveroperatingenvironment.jpg" title="MDM System Operating Environment" id="agentoperatingenvironment"/>
        <h:br/><h:br/>
        The <h:b><abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server</h:b> is an application on a general-purpose platform or on a network device, executing in a trusted network environment. The <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server provides administration of the mobile device policies and reporting on mobile device behavior. The <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server is responsible for managing device enrollment, configuring and sending policies to the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agents, collecting reports on device status, and sending commands to the Agents. The platform on which the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server software runs is either a general-purpose platform, a network device, or a cloud environment. The <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server may be standalone or distributed, where a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is one that requires multiple distinct components to operate as a logical whole in order to fulfil the requirements of this PP (a more extensive description of distributed <abbr linkend="MDM"/>s is given in section 3)
        <h:br/><h:br/>
        The <h:b><abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent</h:b> establishes a secure connection back to the
          <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server controlled by an enterprise administrator and configures the
        mobile device per the administrator's policies. <!--Optionally, the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent
        may interact with the MAS Server to download and install enterprise applications. -->The <abbr
          linkend="MDM"/> Agent is addressed in the Module for <abbr linkend="MDM"/>
        Agents. If the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent is installed on a mobile device as an application
        developed by the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> developer, the <abbr linkend="EP"/> extends this
          <abbr linkend="PP"/> and is included in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. In this case, the <abbr
          linkend="TOE"/> security functionality specified in this <abbr linkend="PP"/> must be
        addressed by the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent in addition to the <abbr linkend="MDM"/>
        Server. Otherwise, the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent is provided by the mobile device vendor
        and is out of scope of this <abbr linkend="PP"/>; however, <abbr linkend="MDM"/>s are
        required to indicate the mobile platforms supported by the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server and
        must be tested against the native <abbr linkend="MDM"/> agent of those platforms.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        <!-- TODO: I still feel like we need to have some definition of what MAS functionality is. We just need minor tweaks to the definition below to include cloud. -->
        <!--
        The <h:b>MAS Server</h:b> is an application on a general-purpose platform or on a
        network device, executing in a trusted network environment. The MAS Server may be separate
        to or included in the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server. The MAS server hosts applications for
        the enterprise, authenticates Agents, and securely transmits applications to enrolled mobile
        devices.

    <section id="usec" title="Use Cases"> This <abbr linkend="PP"/> defines 4 use cases:<h:br/>
      <usecases>
        <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use" id="uc1">
          <description>An Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly
            called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant
            degree of Enterprise control over configuration and software inventory. Enterprise
            administrators use an <abbr linkend="MDM"/> product to establish policies on the mobile
            devices prior to user issuance. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or
            access corporate mail or run Enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under
            significant control of the Enterprise. The user may also be expected to store data and
            use applications for personal, non-enterprise use. The Enterprise administrator uses the
              <abbr linkend="MDM"/> product to deploy security policies and query mobile device
            status. The <abbr linkend="MDM"/> may issue commands for remediation
            actions.</description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for specialized, high-security use" id="uc2">
          <description>An Enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity, tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for specialized, high-security use cases. As in the previous use case, the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> product is used to establish such policies on mobile devices prior to issuance to users. The device may not be permitted connectivity to any external
            peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with
            the Enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use
            of the device may require compliance with usage policies that are more restrictive than
            those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive
            information. Based upon the operation environment and the acceptable risk level of the
            enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this
            Protection Profile along with the selections in the Use Case 2 template defined in
            Appendix E are sufficient for the high-security use case.</description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Personally owned device for personal and enterprise use" id="uc3">
          <description> A personally owned device which is used for both personal activities and
            enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be
            provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has
            occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what
            security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for
            personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the
            device.<h:br/><h:br/> However, because the Enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full)
            access to the Enterprise network, the Enterprise will require certain security policies,
            for example a password or screen lock policy, and health reporting, such as the
            integrity of the mobile device system software, before allowing access. The
            administrator of the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> can establish remediation actions, such as
            wipe of the Enterprise data, for non-compliant devices. These controls could potentially
            be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish
            between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that
            provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by
            the mobile device. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level
            of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this
            Protection Profile along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in
            Appendix E are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Personally owned device for personal and limited enterprise use" id="uc4">
          <description>A personally owned device may also be given access to limited enterprise
            services such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the
            enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security
            policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing
            with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the Mobile Device
            are not compromised. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk
            level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of
            this <abbr linkend="PP"/> are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use

  <!--Begin Distributed TOE -->
  <chapter title="Introduction to Distributed TOEs" id="idt">
    This <abbr linkend="PP"/> includes support for distributed <abbr linkend="MDM"/> <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s. <abbr linkend="MDM"/>'s can sometimes be composed of multiple components operating as a logical whole. Oftentimes we see this architecture when dealing with products hosted in the cloud and offered as Software as a Service. There are a number of different architectures; but fundamentally, they are variations of the following model where the <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> can only be fulfilled if the components are deployed and operate together. To be considered a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, a minimum of 2 interconnected components are required.
    <section title="Registration of components of a distributed TOE" id="rcd"></section>
    When dealing with a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, a number of separate components need to be brought together in the operational environment in order to create the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>: this requires that trusted communications channels are set up between certain pairs of components (it is assumed that all components need to communicate with at least one other component, but not that all components need to communicate with all other components). The underlying model for creation of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is to have a "registration process" in which components "join" the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The registration process starts with two components, one of which (the "joiner") is about to join an existing <abbr linkend="TOE"/> by registering with the other (the "gatekeeper"). The two components will use one or more specified authentication and communication channel options so that the components authenticate each other and protect any sensitive data that is transmitted during the registration process (e.g. a key might be sent by a gatekeeper to the joiner as a result of the registration). The following figures illustrate the three supported registration models. The figure illustrates a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/> registration approach which uses an instance of <linkref linkend="FPT_ITT.1"/> or <linkref linkend="FTP_ITC.1(1)"/> to protect the registration exchange.<h:br/><h:br/>

    <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig1.png" title="Distributed TOE registration using channel satisfying FPT_ITT.1 or FTP_ITC.1(1)" id="DTF1"/>
    <!-- Question: Does it hold true that ITT should be used if cert revocation is not performed and ITC if cert revocation is performed? -->
    <h:br/><h:br/>
    The second approach (Figure 3) utilises an alternative registration channel and supports use cases where the channel relies on environmental security constraints to provide the necessary protection of the registration exchange.<h:br/><h:br/>
    <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig2.png" title="Distributed TOE registration using channel satisfying FTP_TRP.1(3)" id="DTF2"/>
    <h:br/><h:br/>
    The final approach (Figure 4) supports use-cases where registration is performed manually through direct configuration of both the Joiner and Gatekeeper devices. Once configured, the two components establish an internal <abbr linkend="TSF"/> channel that satisfies <linkref linkend="FPT_ITT.1"/> or <linkref linkend="FTP_ITC.1(1)"/>.<h:br/><h:br/>
    <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig3.png" title="Distributed TOE registration without a registration channel" id="DTF3"/>
    <h:br/><h:br/>
    In each case, during the registration process, the Security Administrator must positively enable the joining components before it can act as part of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>. The following figure illustrates the approaches that this enablement step may take;<h:br/><h:br/>
    <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig4.png" title="Joiner enablement options for Distributed TOE's" id="DTF4"/>
    <h:br/><h:br/>
    Note that in the case where no registration channel is required, that is the joiner and gatekeeper are directly configured (Figure 4), enablement is implied as part of this direct configuration process.<h:br/><h:br/>
    After registration the components will communicate between themselves using a normal SSH/TLS/DTLS/IPsec/HTTPS channel (which is specified in an <abbr linkend="ST"/> as an instance of <linkref linkend="FPT_ITT.1"/> or <linkref linkend="FTP_ITC.1(1)"/> in terms of section 6 and appendix A). This channel for intercomponent communications is specified at the top level with the new (extended) <abbr linkend="SFR"/> <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1"/> and is in addition to the other communication channels required for communication with entities outside the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> (which are specified in an <abbr linkend="ST"/> as instances of <linkref linkend="FTP_ITC.1(1)"/> and <linkref linkend="FTP_TRP.1(1)"/>). 
    <section title="Allocation of requirements in distributed TOEs" id="ard"></section>
    For a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, the security functional requirements in this <abbr linkend="PP"/> need to be met by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> as a whole, but not all <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s will necessarily be implemented by all components. The following categories are defined in order to specify when each <abbr linkend="SFR"/> must be implemented by a component:<h:br/>
    <h:ul>
      <h:li><h:b>All Components ("All")</h:b> - All components that comprise the distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/> must independently satisfy the requirement.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>At least one Component ("One")</h:b> - This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one component within the distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>.</h:li>
      <h:li><h:b>Feature Dependent ("Feature Dependent")</h:b> - These requirements will only be fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/> component (note that the requirement to meet the <abbr linkend="PP"/> as a whole requires that at least one component implements these requirements if they are specified in <!--section 6 will not make sense -->section 6).</h:li>
    </h:ul>
    <h:br/>
    <h:center>Table 1 specifies how each of the <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s in this <abbr linkend="PP"/> must be met, using the categories above.</h:center>

    The Security Functional Requirements included in this section are derived from Part 2 of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 4, with additional extended functional components.
    <h:br/><h:br/>
    For a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author should reference Table 1 for guidance on how each <abbr linkend="SFR"/> should be met. The table details whether <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s should be met by all <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components, by at least one <abbr linkend="TOE"/> component or whether they are dependent upon the feature being implemented by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> component. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> for a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/> must include a mapping of <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s to each of the components of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. (Note that this deliverable is examined as part of the ASE_TSS.1<!--???--> and AVA_VAN.1 Evaluation Activities.)
    <section id="con" title="Conventions"> 
      The <abbr linkend="CC"/> defines operations on Security Functional Requirements: assignments, selections, assignments within selections and refinements. This document uses the following font conventions to identify the operations defined by the <abbr linkend="CC"/>: <h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:ul>
        <h:li><h:b>Refinement</h:b> operation (denoted by <h:b>bold text</h:b>) is used to add details to a requirement, and thus further restricts a requirement</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b>Selection</h:b> (denoted by italicized text): is used to select one or more options provided by the [CC] in stating a requirement.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b>Assignment</h:b> operation (denoted by italicized text) is used to assign a specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the length of a password. Showing the value in square brackets indicates assignment.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b>Iteration</h:b> operation: are identified with a number inside parentheses (e.g. "(1)").</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b>Extended <abbr linkend="SFR"/>s</h:b>: are identified by having a label "EXT" after the <abbr linkend="SFR"/> name. </h:li>

              Item b above requires all administrative actions to be auditable. Administrative actions refer to any management functions specified by <linkref linkend="FMT_MOF.1(1)"/>.

It would be possible that every component also stores its own audit information locally as well as every component could be able to send out audit data to an external audit server. It would also be sufficient that every component would be able to generate its own audit data and buffer it locally before the information is sent out to one or more other <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components for local storage and/or transmission to an external audit server. For the transfer of audit records between <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components the secure connection via FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1 must be used.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              Such a solution would still be suitable to fulfil the requirement that all audit-related <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s have to be fulfilled by all <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components, although formally not every component would support local storage or transfer to an external audit server itself.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              Regarding the establishment of inter-<abbr linkend="TOE"/> communication, error conditions as well as successful connection/teardown events should be captured by both ends of the connection.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              Although all <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components shall be able to generate their own audit data according to FAU_GEN.1 for all the <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s that they implement, not all <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components have to provide audit data about all events. For distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s a mapping shall be provided to show which auditable events according to FAU_GEN.1 are covered by which components (also giving a justification that the records generated by each component cover all the <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s that it implements). The overall <abbr linkend="TOE"/> has to provide audit information about all events defined for FAU_GEN.1. As a result, at least one <abbr linkend="TOE"/> component has to be assigned to every auditable event defined for FAU_GEN.1. The part of the mapping related to Table 2 shall be consistent with the mapping of <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s to <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components for ASE_TSS.1 in the sense that all components defined as generating audit information for a particular SFR should also contribute to that SFR in the mapping for ASE_TSS.1. This applies not only to audit events defined for mandatory <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s but also to all audit events for optional and selection-based <abbr linkend="SFR"/>'s as defined in Appendix A and Appendix B.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              If one or more of the optional audit components FAU_STG_EXT.1 or FAU_STG_EXT.2 are selected in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> derived from this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, then the <abbr linkend="SFR"/> mapping for ASE_TSS.1 must include a specific identification of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components to which they apply.

            </selectables> to enable an Administrator to disable communications between any pair of <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components.</title>
            <note>
              This <abbr linkend="SFR"/> is only applicable if the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is distributed and therefore has multiple components that need to communicate via an internal <abbr linkend="TSF"/> channel. When creating the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> from the initial pair of components, either of these components may be identified as the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> for the purposes of satisfying the meaning of "<abbr linkend="TSF"/>" in this <abbr linkend="SFR"/>. <h:br/><h:br/>
              
              The intention of this requirement is to ensure that there is a registration process that includes a positive enablement step by an Administrator before components joining a distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/> can communicate with the other components of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> and before the new component can act as part of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>. The registration process may itself involve communication with the joining component: many implementations use a bespoke process for this, and the security requirements for the "registration communication" are then defined in <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2"/>. Use of this "registration communication" channel is not deemed inconsistent with the requirement of <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1.1"/> (i.e. the registration channel can be used before the enablement step, but only in order to complete the registration process).<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              The channel selection (for the registration channel) in <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2"/> is essentially a choice between the use of a normal secure channel that is equivalent to a channel used to communicate with external IT entities (FTP_ITC.1) or existing <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components (FPT_ITT.1), or else a separate type of channel that is specific to registration (FTP_TRP.1(3)). If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> does not require a communications channel for registration (e.g. because the registration is achieved entirely by configuration actions by an Administrator at each of the components) then the main selection in <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2"/> is completed with the "No channel" option.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              If the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author selects the FTP_ITC.1/FPT_ITT.1 channel type in the main selection in <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2"/> then the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> identifies the relevant <abbr linkend="SFR"/> iteration that specifies the channel used. If the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author selects the FTP_TRP.1/Join channel type, then the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> (possibly with support from the operational guidance) describes details of the channel and the mechanisms that it uses (and describes how the registration process ensures that the channel can only be used by the intended joiner and gatekeeper). Note that the FTP_TRP.1(3) channel type may require support from security measures in the operational environment (see the definition of FTP_TRP.1(3) for details).<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              If the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author selects the FTP_ITC.1/FPT_ITT.1 channel type in the main selection in <linkref linkend="FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2"/> then the <abbr linkend="ST"/> identifies the registration channel as a separate iteration of FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1 and gives the iteration identifier (e.g. "FPT_ITT.1/Join") in an <abbr linkend="ST"/> Application Note for FCO_CPC_EXT.1.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              Note that the channel set up and used for registration may be adopted as a continuing internal communication channel (i.e. between different <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components) provided that the channel meets the requirements of FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1. Otherwise the registration channel is closed after use and a separate channel is used for the internal communications.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              Specific requirements for Preparative Procedures relating to FCO_CPC_EXT.1 are defined in the Evaluation Activities.

              <h:h4>If "implement functionality" is selected:</h:h4>
              <TSS/>The evaluator shall ensure that the supported key establishment schemes
                correspond to the key generation schemes identified in <linkref linkend="FCS_CKM.1.1"/>. If the <abbr

                Special Publication 800-56B, the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> must not reveal the
                particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or
                logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS- OAEP is supported, the
                evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the
                three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section
                7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure that
                any outputted or logged error message is identical for each. If KTS-KEM-KWS is
                supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that
                trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special

                how to configure the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to use the selected key establishment
              scheme(s).<h:br/><h:br/>
              <Tests/>The evaluator shall verify the implementation of the key establishment schemes
                supported by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> using the applicable tests below.
                  <h:h4>SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes</h:h4> The evaluator shall verify a
                  <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using
                the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key
                agreement scheme verify that a <abbr linkend="TOE"/> has implemented the components
                of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation.
                These components include the calculation of the primitives (the shared secret value
                Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation
                Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify
                that the components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the
                test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of the DKM, the
                generation of MACdata and the calculation of MACtag.<h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:u>Function Test</h:u><h:br/><h:br/> The Function test verifies the ability of the
                  <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct
                this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good
                implementation of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supported schemes. For each supported
                key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported,
                key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate
                10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values
                (FFC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are
                static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.<h:br/><h:br/> The
                evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the corresponding <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s public
                keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such
                as the Other Information field OI and <abbr linkend="TOE"/> id fields.<h:br/><h:br/> If
                the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator
                shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared
                secret.<h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the <abbr
                  linkend="TSF"/>'s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good
                implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM,
                and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<h:br/><h:br/> If key
                confirmation is supported, the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> shall perform the above for
                each implemented approved MAC algorithm. <h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:u>Validity Test</h:u><h:br/><h:br/> The Validity test verifies the ability of the
                  <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to recognize another party's valid and invalid key agreement
                results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall
                obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A
                key agreement implementation to determine which errors the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>
                should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC)
                test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST
                approved curves, the evaluator's public keys, the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s
                public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other
                info and <abbr linkend="TOE"/> id fields.<h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall inject an
                error in some of the test vectors to test that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> recognizes
                invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the
                shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be
                MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> contains the full or
                partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually
                inject errors in both parties' static public keys, both parties' ephemeral public
                keys and the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s static private key to assure the <abbr
                  linkend="TOE"/> detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the
                partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors
                shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
                (they should pass).<h:br/><h:br/> The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> shall use these modified test
                vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The
                evaluator shall compare the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>'s results with the results using a
                known good implementation verifying that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> detects these errors.<h:br/><h:br/>
                <h:h4>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</h:h4> The evaluator shall verify that
                the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> describes whether the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> acts as a
                sender, a recipient, or both for RSA-based key establishment schemes.<h:br/><h:br/> If
                the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> acts as a sender, the following evaluation activity shall
                be performed to ensure the proper operation of every <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supported
                combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme:<h:br/><h:br/> To conduct this test the
                evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of
                the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supported schemes. For each combination of supported key
                establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation if supported,
                for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation is supported,
                and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is supported), the
                tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector shall include the
                RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional input parameters if
                applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is incorporated, and the
                outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator shall perform a key
                establishment encryption operation on the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> with the same inputs
                (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MacKey from
                the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal operation)
                and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext in the test
                vector.<h:br/><h:br/> If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> acts as a receiver, the following
                assurance activities shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every
                  <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supported combination of RSA-based key establishment
                scheme:<h:br/><h:br/> To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test
                vectors from a known good implementation of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> supported
                schemes. For each combination of supported key establishment scheme and its options
                (with our without key confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation
                MAC function if key confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask
                generation function if KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of
                test vectors. Each test vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext
                keying material (KeyData), any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag
                in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For
                each test vector, the evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption
                operation on the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> and ensure that the outputted plaintext
                keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to the plaintext keying material in the test
                vector. In cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the evaluator shall perform
                the key confirmation steps and ensure that the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the
                MacTag in the test vector.

            <note role="application">The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author should select "invoking platform-provided functionality" if the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server performs no operations using plaintext secret, private cryptographic keys, and <abbr linkend="CSP"/>s. <h:br/><h:br/>
              Any security related information (such as keys, authentication data, and passwords) must be zeroized when no longer in use to prevent the disclosure or modification of security critical data.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The zeroization indicated above applies to each intermediate storage area for plaintext key and Cryptographic Service Provider (<abbr linkend="CSP"/>) (i.e., any storage, such as memory buffers, that is included in the path of such data) upon the transfer of the key/<abbr linkend="CSP"/> to another location.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Since the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> does not include the host IT environment, the extent of this capability is necessarily somewhat limited. For the purposes of this requirement, it is sufficient for the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to invoke the correct underlying functions of the host to perform the zeroization--it does not imply that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> has to include a kernel-mode memory driver to ensure the data are zeroized. It is  assumed that the host platform appropriately performs zeroization of key material in its internal processes.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Several selections allow assignment of a 'value that does not contain any CSP'. This means that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> uses some other specified data not drawn from a source that may contain key material or reveal information about key material, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point of the phrase "does not contain any CSP" is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general 'pool' that might contain current or residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.

                  There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the evaluator shall compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation.<h:br/><h:br/>

                    <test> KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all-zeros key.<h:br/><h:br/> To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.</test><h:br/><h:br/> 
                    <test>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit keys.<h:br/><h:br/> 
                      To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and AES-CBC decryption.</test><h:br/><h:br/> 
                    <test>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N].<h:br/><h:br/> 
                      To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key and
                ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that results
                from AES-CBC decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an IV of all
                zeros. The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit key/ciphertext
                pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit
                key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and
                the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in each pair
                shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted with its
                corresponding key.</test><h:br/><h:br/> 
                    <test>KAT-4. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the
                evaluator shall supply the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain
                the two ciphertext values that result from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext
                using a 128-bit key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit
                key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value i in

                <test>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test<h:br/><h:br/> 
                The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an
                i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;=10. The evaluator shall choose a key, an IV and
                plaintext message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be
                tested, with the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result

                The evaluator shall also test the decrypt functionality for each
                mode by decrypting an i-block message where 1 &lt; i &lt;=10. The evaluator shall
                choose a key, an IV and a ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the
                message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext
                shall be compared to the result of decrypting the same ciphertext message with the
                same key and IV using a known good implementation.</test> <h:br/><h:br/>
                
                <test>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests<h:br/><h:br/> 
                  The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3-tuples. 100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:<h:br/><h:br/>
              <h:pre>
                # Input: PT, IV, Key
                for i = 1 to 1000:
                    if i == 1:
                        CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                        PT = IV
                    else:
                        CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT)

              <h:br/>             
                The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the
                result for that trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000
                iterations with the same values using a known good implementation.<h:br/><h:br/> The
                evaluator shall test the decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt,

              <Tests/> The evaluator shall perform the following tests.<h:br/><h:br/> The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration. The evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate instructions for configuring the RNG  functionality.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 - 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly generated. "generate one block of random bits" means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP 800-90A).<h:br/><h:br/> 
              If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 - 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              The following paragraphs contain more information on some of the input values to be generated/selected by the evaluator.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Entropy input: the length of the entropy input value must equal the seed length.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Nonce: If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Personalization string: The length of the personalization string must be less than or equal to seed length. If the implementation only supports one personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a personalization string, no value needs to be supplied.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Additional input: the additional input bit lengths have the same defaults and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.<h:br/><h:br/>

            <note role="application">Often a connection must be established to perform a verification of the revocation status of a certificate - either to download a CRL or to perform OCSP. The selection is used to describe the behavior in the event that such a connection cannot be established (for example, due to a network error). If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> has determined the certificate valid according to all other rules in <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.1(1)"/>, the behavior indicated in the second selection shall determine the validity. The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> must not accept the certificate if it fails any of the other validation rules in <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.1(1)"/>. If the administrator-configured option is selected by the <abbr linkend="ST"/> Author, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> Author must also select function d in <linkref linkend="FMT_SMF.1(2)"/>.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is distributed and FIA_X509_EXT.1(2) is selected, then certificate revocation checking is optional. This is due to additional authorization actions being performed in the enabling and disabling of the intra-<abbr linkend="TOE"/> trusted channel as defined in FCO_CPC_EXT.1. In this case, a connection is not required to determine certificate validity and this <abbr linkend="SFR"/> is trivially satisfied.

The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author can add more commands and configuration policies by completing the appropriate assignment statements.<h:br/><h:br/> The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author shall not claim any functionality not provided by the Mobile Device.

              Function-specific Application Notes:<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Function specific application notes reference Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) <abbr linkend="PP"/> v3.1.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Function <ctr-ref refid="smf12"/> may be satisfied for the BYOD use case by application blacklisting and/or disabling. In the case of BYOD, and enterprise may not want to remove "personal" applications, thus for that use case disabling the application rather than removing it would allow the user to not loose any information they might have in the application.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Function <ctr-ref refid="smf16"/> provides the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> server to display an alert to the user of the mobile device.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              The audit records read according to Function <ctr-ref refid="smf19"/> are to be transmitted to an external audit server according to <linkref linkend="FAU_STG_EXT.1(1)"/>. The <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server is not expected to retain those logs.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Function <ctr-ref refid="smf34"/> provides the ability to enable/disable policy for the list of protocols where the device acts as a server, such as a mobile hotspot.<h:br/><h:br/>  
              Function <ctr-ref refid="smf56"/> corresponds to FPT_NET_EXT.1.1 in Agent. If the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Agent has not had a successful reachability event with the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server in the amount of time specified in 'a', then the agent shall perform the action selected in 'b'. It is feasible, but not required, that if multiple actions are selected in 'b', each action could be associated with a different timeout in 'a'. If function <ctr-ref refid="smf56"/> is included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, than FPT_NET_EXT.1.1 shall be included in the Agent <abbr linkend="ST"/>. </note>

            <note role="application"> This requirement captures all the configuration functionality in the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server to configure the underlying <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author can add more commands and configuration policies by completing the assignment statement.<h:br/><h:br/> Function a can be met by relying on the platform to configure the certificates used by the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> server, however, the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> Server shall allow the administrator to choose which certificate is used for a specific functionality. The selection in b corresponds to the selection in <linkref linkend="FIA_ENR_EXT.1.2"/>. The selection in c includes a function that corresponds to the selection in <linkref linkend="FIA_X509_EXT.2.2"/>. Function e allows the administrator to configure periodicity of assigned commands, for example "read audit logs kept by the Mobile Device". In this way the administrator can configure the <abbr linkend="MDM"/> system to retrieve audit logs from the Mobile Device on a periodic, such as daily, basis in order to ensure freshness of log data and to minimize loss of audit logs. Function f allows the administrator to configure the privacy-sensitive information that will and will not be collected from particular mobile devices to handle Bring Your Own Device environments where some information may not be appropriate to collect. Privacy sensitive information may include items such as device physical location and lists of installed personal applications, and would vary depending on the particular capabilities of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> and <abbr linkend="MDM"/> agent. The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> should provide the capability to group enrolled devices into categories such as enterprise-owned and personal-owned and define the information that will be collected from devices in each category. Function g corresponds to configuring the length of time the user authenticator for enrollment is valid in <linkref linkend="FMT_SAE_EXT.1"/>. This function shall be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/> if and only if <linkref linkend="FMT_SAE_EXT.1"/> is included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              For distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s the interaction between <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components will be configurable (see FCO_CPC_EXT.1). Therefore, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author includes the selection "Ability to configure the interaction between <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components" for distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s. A simple example would be the change of communication protocol according to FPT_ITT.1. Another example would be changing the management of a <abbr linkend="TOE"/> component from direct remote administration to remote administration through another <abbr linkend="TOE"/> component. A more complex use case would be if the realization of an <abbr linkend="SFR"/> is achieved through two or more <abbr linkend="TOE"/> components and the responsibilities between the two or more components could be modified.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              For distributed <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s that implement a registration channel (as described in FCO_CPC_EXT.1.2), the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author uses the selection "configure the cryptographic functionality" in this <abbr linkend="SFR"/>, and its corresponding mapping in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/>, to describe the configuration of any cryptographic aspects of the registration channel that can be modified by the operational environment in order to improve the channel security.

              Protection (by one of the listed protocols) is required at least for communications with the server that collects 
              the audit information. If it communicates with an authentication server (e.g., RADIUS), then the <abbr linkend="ST"/> 
              author chooses "authentication server" in <linkref linkend="FTP_ITC.1.1(1)"/> and this connection must be protected

              that are used to protect those connections).<h:br/><h:br/> 
              To summarize, the connection to an external audit collection server is required to be protected by one of the listed 
              protocols. If an external authentication server is supported, then it is required to protect that connection with one 
              of the listed protocols. For any other external server, external communications are not required to be protected, but 
              if protection is claimed, then it must be protected with one of the identified protocols.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              <!--TODO REVIEW FOR CORRECTNESS-->
              For communications with any authorized IT entities outside of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, the MDM Server should still 
              be able to support mutual authentication. There are no requirements levied on the external entities, but the MDM Server

              provides assured identification of its end points and protection of the channel data
              from modification or disclosure.</title>
            <note role="application"> The intent of the mandatory portion of the above requirement
              is to use the cryptographic protocols identified in the requirement to establish and
              maintain a trusted channel with authorized IT entities that the MAS Server interacts
              with to perform its functions.<h:br/><h:br/> Protection (by one of the listed protocols) is
              required at least for communications with the server that collects the audit
              information. If it communicates with an authentication server (e.g., RADIUS), then the
                <abbr linkend="ST"/> author chooses "authentication server" in <linkref linkend="FTP_ITC.1.1(1)"/> and
              this connection must be protected by one of the listed protocols. If other authorized
              IT entities (e.g., NTP server) are protected, the <abbr linkend="ST"/> author makes
              the appropriate assignments (for those entities) and selections (for the protocols
              that are used to protect those connections). <h:br/><h:br/> 
              To summarize, the connection to an external audit collection server is required to be protected by 
              one of the listed protocols. If an external authentication server is supported, then it is required to
              protect that connection with one of the listed protocols. For any other external
              server, external communications are not required to be protected, but if protection is
              claimed, then it must be protected with one of the identified protocols.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              <TODO REVIEW FOR CORRECTNESS>
              For communications with any authorized IT entities outside of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, the MAS Server should still 
              be able to support mutual authentication. There are no requirements levied on the external entities, but the MAS Server 
              should be able to support mutual authentication. This way if the non-<abbr linkend="TOE"/> authorized 
              entitiy does support mutual authenticaion, the MAS Server is in a position to make use of that.<h:br/><h:br/>
              <TODO END REVIEW>
              The trusted channel uses IPsec, TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS as the protocol that preserves the
              confidentiality and integrity of MAS communications. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author
              chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. If "IPsec"
              is selected the Extended Package for IPsec VPN Clients must be included in the <abbr
                linkend="ST"/>. If "SSH" is selected the Extended Package for Secure Shell must be
              included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. If "HTTPS" is selected the
              appropriate selection-based <abbr linkend="SFR"/>s from Appendix B must be included in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/>.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If "TLS" or "DTLS" is selected the TLS Functional Package must be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, 
              with the following selections made:
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>FCS_TLS_EXT.1: 
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>either TLS or DTLS is selected depending on the selection made in FTP_ITC.1.1(3)</h:li>
                    <h:li>either client or server is selected as appropariate</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
                <h:li>FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1 or FCS_TLSS_EXT.1.1 (as appropriate):
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cannot be selected</h:li>
                    <h:li>mutual authentication must be selected</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
                <h:br/><h:br/> 
              </h:ul>
              Protocol, RBG, Certificate validation, algorithm,
              and similar services may be met with platform provided services.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              The requirement implies that not only are communications protected when they are initially
              established, but also on resumption after an outage. It may be the case that some part
              of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> setup involves manually setting up tunnels to protect
              other communication, and if after an outage the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> attempts to
              re-establish the communication automatically with (the necessary) manual intervention,
              there may be a window created where an attacker might be able to gain critical
              information or compromise a connection.<h:br/><h:br/>

              The effect of this <abbr linkend="SFR"/> is to require the ability for components to communicate in a secure manner while the distributed <abbr linkend="TSF"/> is being created (or when adding components to an existing distributed <abbr linkend="TSF"/>). When creating the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> from the initial pair of components, either of these components may be identified as the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> for the purposes of satisfying the meaning of "<abbr linkend="TSF"/>" in this <abbr linkend="SFR"/>.<h:br/><h:br/>

              The selection at the end of FTP_TRP.1.1(3) recognises that in some cases confidentiality (i.e. protection of the data from disclosure) may not be provided by the channel. The ST author distinguishes in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> whether in this case the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> relies on the environment to provide confidentiality (as part of the constraints referenced in FTP_TRP.1.3(3)) or whether the registration data exchanged does not require confidentiality (in which case this assertion must be justified). If "none" is selected, then this word may be omitted in the ST to improve readability.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              The assignment in FTP_TRP.1.3(3) ensures that the <abbr linkend="ST"/> highlights any specific details needed to protect the registration environment. Note that when the <abbr linkend="ST"/> uses FTP_TRP.1(3) for the registration channel then this channel cannot be reused as the normal inter-component communication channel (the latter channel must meet FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1). Specific requirements for Preparative Procedures relating to FTP_TRP.1(3) are defined in the Evaluation Activities.<h:br/><h:br/>

  <chapter id="sar" title="Security Assurance Requirements"> 
    The Security Objectives for the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> in <secref linkend="req"/> were constructed to address threats identified in <secref linkend="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s) in <secref linkend="req"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The <abbr linkend="PP"/> identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing. <h:br/><h:br/> 
    This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from <abbr linkend="CC"/> part 3 that are required in evaluations against this <abbr linkend="PP"/>. Individual Assurance Activities (AAs) to be performed are specified both in <secref linkend="req"/> as well as in this section. <h:br/><h:br/> 
    The general model for evaluation of <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s against <abbr linkend="ST"/>s written to conform to this <abbr linkend="PP"/> is as follows: <h:br/><h:br/> 
    After the <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded" title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other <abbr linkend="CEM"/> assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is compliant with the <abbr linkend="PP"/>. <h:br/><h:br/>
    The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> security assurance requirements are identified in Table 2.

          The functional specification describes the Target Security Functions Interfaces (TSFIs). It is not necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally, because <abbr linkend="TOE"/>s conforming to this <abbr linkend="PP"/> will necessarily have interfaces to the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <abbr linkend="TOE"/> users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this <abbr linkend="PP"/>, the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces presented in the AGD documentation.

  <appendix id="entropy" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment"> 
    This appendix describes the required supplementary information for each entropy source used by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>.<h:br/><h:br/> The documentation of the entropy source(s) should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation is not required to be part of the <abbr linkend="TSS"/>. <h:br/><h:br/>
    <section id="sec1" title="Design Description"> Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product.<h:br/><h:br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.<h:br/><h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.<h:br/><h:br/> If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.<h:br/><h:br/>
    </section>
    <section id="sec2" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical argument for where
      the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy
      source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular
        <abbr linkend="TOE"/>). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> randomizer seeding process. This
      discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to
      produce bits with entropy.<h:br/><h:br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the
      expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the
      product.<h:br/><h:br/> For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy
      rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical
      tests will be performed, and the min- entropy rate determined from the statistical tests.
      While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some
      testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output.<h:br/><h:br/>
      For third party provided entropy sources, in which the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> vendor has
      limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will
      indicate an estimate of the amount of min- entropy obtained from this third-party source. It
      is acceptable for the vendor to "assume" an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption
      must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate
      must be specified and the assumption included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>.<h:br/><h:br/> Regardless
      of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized
      with the entropy stated in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, for example by verifying that the
      min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the
      rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared
      to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or
      the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete.<h:br/><h:br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from
      any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.<h:br/><h:br/>
    </section>
    <section id="sec3" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be affected by conditions
      outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency,
      temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the
      operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of
      operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data.
      Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no
      longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation
      of the source shall be included.<h:br/><h:br/>
    </section>
    <section id="sec4" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source health tests
      and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
      the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, <abbr linkend="TOE"/>
      behavior upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be
      appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.<h:br/><h:br/>

  <appendix id="EACDT" title="Evaluating Additional Components for a Distributed TOE">
    In the case of a distributed TOE the Security Target will identify an evaluated configuration that consists of a number of separate components chosen by the ST author, which collectively satisfy the requirements of the PP. This evaluated configuration need not be the minimum set of components that could possibly meet the PP (e.g. if the TOE is intended for large enterprise deployments then the evaluated configuration might include some redundancy in components in order to support expected connectivity and loads), but because this is the main configuration referred to in the ST and the evaluation, it is treated in this section as the minimum configuration of interest and is referred to here as the 'minimum configuration' as well as the 'evaluated configuration'.<h:br/><h:br/>
    
    In addition to the minimum configuration above, the ST may also identify (at the author's discretion, and subject to verification as described in this section) which TOE components can have instances added to an operational configuration without affecting the validity of the CC certification. The ST description may include constraints on how such components are added, including required and/or prohibited configurations of the components.<h:br/><h:br/>
    
    Extra instances of a TOE component must have the same hardware and software as the original component included in the evaluated configuration.<h:br/><h:br/>
    <section title="Evaluator Actions for Assessing the ST" id="sec1">
      <TSS/>The evaluator shall examine the TSS to identify any extra instances of TOE components allowed in the ST and shall examine the description of how the additional components maintain the SFRs to confirm that it is consistent with the role that the component plays in the evaluated configuration. For example: the secure channels used by the extra component for intra-TOE communications (FPT_ITT) and external communications (FTP_ITC) must be consistent, the audit information generated by the extra component must be maintained, and the management of the extra component must be consistent with that used for the original instance of the component in the minimum configuration.
    </section>
    <section title="Evaluator Actions for Assessing the Guidance Documentation" id="sec2">
      <Guidance/>The evaluator shall examine the description of the extra instances of TOE components in the guidance documentation to confirm that they are consistent with those identified as allowed in the ST. This includes confirmation that the result of applying the guidance documentation to configure the extra component will leave the TOE in a state such that the claims for SFR support in each component are as described in the ST and therefore that all SFRs continue to be met when the extra components are present.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      The evaluator shall examine the secure communications described for the extra components to confirm that they are the same as described for the components in the minimum configuration (additional connections between allowed extra components and the components in the minimum configuration are allowed of course).<h:br/><h:br/>    
    </section> 
    <section title="Evaluator Actions for Testing the TOE" id="sec3">
      <Tests/>The evaluator tests the TOE in the minimum configuration as defined in the ST (and the guidance documentation).<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      If the description of the use of extra components in the ST and guidance documentation identifies any difference in the SFRs allocated to a component, or the scope of the SFRs involved (e.g. if different selections apply to different instances of the component) then the evaluator tests these additional SFR cases that were not included in the minimum configuration.<h:br/><h:br/>
      
      In addition the evaluator tests the following aspects for each extra component that is identified as allowed in the distributed TOE:<h:br/><h:br/>
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Communications: the evaluator follows the guidance documentation to confirm, by testing, that any additional connections introduced with the extra component and not present in the minimum configuration are consistent with the requirements stated in the ST ( e.g. with regard to protocols and ciphersuites used). An example of such an additional connection would be if a single instance of the component is present in the minimum configuration and adding a duplicate component then introduces an extra communication between the two instances. Another example might be if the use of the additional components necessitated the use of a connection to an external authentication server instead of using locally stored credentials. </h:li>
        <h:li>Audit: the evaluator confirms that the audit records from different instances of a component can be distinguished so that it is clear which instance generated the record.</h:li>
        <h:li>Management: if the extra component manages other components in the distributed TOE then the evaluator shall follow the guidance documentation to confirm that management via the extra component uses the same roles and role holders for administrators as for the component in the minimum configuration.</h:li>

  <appendix id="use-case" title="Use Case Templates"> 
    The following use case templates list those selections, assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this Protection Profile. Note that the templates assume that all <abbr linkend="SFR"/>s listed in Section 5 are included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, not just those listed in the templates. These templates and deviations from the template should be identified in the Security Target to assist customers with making risk-based purchasing decisions. Products that do not meet these templates are not precluded from use in the scenarios identified by this Protection Profile. Where selections for a particular requirement are not identified in a use case template, all available selections are equally applicable to the use case.
