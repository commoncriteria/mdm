    <section id="ov" title="Overview">
      Mobile Device Management (MDM) products allow enterprises to apply security policies to managed devices (MDs), such as smartphones, tablets, and workstations. The purpose of 
			these policies is to establish a security posture adequate to permit MDs to process enterprise data and connect to enterprise network
			resources.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      This document provides a baseline set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for an MDM system, which is the Target of Evaluation (TOE). The MDM 
			system is only one component of an enterprise deployment of MDs. Other components, such as the MD platforms, which enforce 
			the security policies and network access control servers are out of scope.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="cte">
      The Mobile Device Management (MDM) system consists of two primary components: the MDM server software and the MDM agent. Optionally, the MDM system may
			consist of a separate Mobile Application Store (MAS) server.
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        The MDM system operational environment consists of the MD on which the MDM agent resides, 
				the platform on which the MDM server runs, and an untrusted wireless network over which they communicate, as pictured below.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        <figure entity="images/MDMserveroperatingenvironment.jpg" title="MDM System Operating Environment" id="agentoperatingenvironment"/>
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The
        <h:b>MDM server</h:b>
        is software (an application, service, etc.) on a general-purpose platform, a network device, or cloud architecture executing
				in a trusted network environment. The MDM server provides administration of MD policies and reporting on the device behavior.
				The MDM server is responsible for managing device enrollment, configuring and sending policies to the MDM agents, collecting reports on device
				status, and sending commands to the agents. The MDM server may be standalone or distributed, where a distributed TOE is one that requires
				multiple distinct components to operate as a logical whole in order to fulfill the requirements of this PP (a more extensive description of 
				distributed MDMs is given in section 3).
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The
        <h:b>MDM agent</h:b>
        establishes a secure connection back to the
				MDM server controlled by an enterprise administrator and configures the
				MD per the administrator's policies. The MDM agent is addressed in the PP-Module for MDM
				Agents. If the MDM agent is installed on a MD as an application
				developed by the MDM developer, the PP-Module extends this PP and is included in the TOE. In this case, the TOE security 
				functionality specified in this PP must be
				addressed by the MDM agent in addition to the MDM
				Server. Otherwise, the MDM agent is provided by the MD vendor
				and is out of scope of this PP; however, MDMs are
				required to indicate the device platforms supported by the MDM server and
				must be tested against the native MDM agent of those platforms.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The
        <h:b>Mobile Application Store (MAS)</h:b>
        hosts applications for the enterprise, authenticates agents, and securely transmits 
				applications to enrolled MDs. The MAS functionality can be included as part of the MDM server Software or can be logically
				distinct. If the MAS functionality is on a physically separate server, then the TOE is
				distributed with the MDM server and MAS server being 
				separate components.
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>
    </section>
    <sec:Use_Cases>
      This PP defines four use cases:
      <h:br/>
      <usecases>
        <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use" id="uc1">
          <description>An enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly
						called Corporate-Owned, Personally-Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant
						degree of enterprise control over configuration and software inventory. Enterprise
						administrators use an MDM product to establish policies on the MDs prior to user issuance. Users may use internet connectivity to browse the web, access corporate mail, or run enterprise 
						applications, but this connectivity may be under
						significant control of the enterprise. The user may also be expected to store data and
						use applications for personal, non-enterprise use. The enterprise administrator uses the
						MDM product to deploy security policies and query MD
						status. The MDM may issue commands for remediation
						actions.</description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for specialized, high-security use" id="uc2">
          <description>An enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity, tightly controlled configuration,
						and limited software inventory is appropriate for specialized, high-security use cases. As in the previous use case, the MDM
						product is used to establish such policies on MDs prior to issuance to users. The device may not be permitted
						connectivity to any external
						peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with
						the enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the internet. Use
						of the device may require compliance with usage policies that are more restrictive than
						those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive
						information. Based on the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the
						enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this
						PP along with the selections in the Use Case 2 template defined in
						Appendix G are sufficient for the high-security use case.</description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Personally-owned device for personal and enterprise use" id="uc3">
          <description>
            A personally-owned device which is used for both personal activities and
						enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be
						provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has
						occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what
						security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for
						personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the
						device.
            <h:br/>
            <h:br/>
            However, because the enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full)
						access to the enterprise network, the enterprise will require certain security policies,
						for example a password or screen lock policy and health reporting, such as the
						integrity of the MD system software, before allowing access. The
						administrator of the MDM can establish remediation actions, such as
						wipe of the enterprise data, for non-compliant devices. These controls could potentially
						be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish
						between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that
						provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by
						the MD. Based on the operational environment and the acceptable risk level
						of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this
						PP along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in
						Appendix G are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Personally-owned device for personal and limited enterprise use" id="uc4">
          <description>A personally-owned device may also be given access to limited enterprise services such as enterprise email. The enterprise may not
						need to enforce any security policies on this device because the user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data.
						However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the
						device are not compromised. Based on the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security
						functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this PP are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.</description>

    For a distributed TOE, the ST author should reference
    <xref to="distTOE"/>
    for guidance on how each SFR should be met. The table details whether
		SFRs should be met by all TOE components, by at least one TOE component or whether they are dependent on the feature being implemented by the
		TOE component. The ST for a distributed TOE must include a mapping of SFRs to each of the components of the TOE. (Note that this deliverable 
		is examined as part of the ASE_TSS.1 and AVA_VAN.1 Evaluation Activities.)
    <h:b>Test Environment for Evaluation Activities</h:b>
    <h:p/>
    As described in the evaluation activities below, the ST for an MDM system is required to list all the supported MDM agents and MD platforms with which
			an MDM server operates. The identified evaluation activities for testing that includes the use of an agent should be completed for each MDM agent
			and platform listed in the ST.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    The evaluator's activities for testing that include use of an agent will ensure that the Server interacts appropriately with the agent (i.e., sends a
			policy update to the agent), but will not ensure that the agent handles the received data correctly (i.e., appropriately applies the policy to the 
			device), as that is accounted for in the Evaluation Activities in the Mobile Device Fundamentals PP or the PP-Module for Mobile Device Management
			Agents.

              This requirement outlines the events for which audit data must be generated by either the MDM system or the
				MDM server platform. Each audit data event may be written by the MDM system or may be dispatched to the operating system on which 
				it runs. It is acceptable to select both "invoke platform-provided functionality" and "implement functionality." It should be specified
				which auditable events are completed by the MDM system and which are completed by the MDM platform.

              The ST author can include other auditable events in the assignment; they are not limited to the list presented. All audits must contain at least

              <h:br/>
              For distributed TOEs, each component must generate audit data for each of the SFRs that it implements. If more than one TOE component is
				involved when an audit event is triggered, the event has to be audited on each component (e.g., rejection of a connection by one component
				while attempting to establish a secure communication channel between two components should result in an audit event being generated by
				both components). This is not limited to error cases but also includes events about successful actions like successful build up or tear down 
				of a secure communication channel between TOE components.

              above requires all administrative actions to be auditable. Administrative actions refer to any management functions specified by 
				FMT_MOF.1/FUNCBE. Thus no additional specification for the auditability of these actions is specified in
              <xref g="t-audit-mandatory"/>
              aside 
				from those that require additional record content. If the TOE is distributed and the given component does not deal with setting the policy 
				applied to the MDM agent, it is acceptable to not have any administrative actions to audit.

                Per
                <xref to="fel-gen-func-tsf"/>, audit data may be generated by the TOE, the platform, or both. If audit data is generated by the TOE, the TSF must have the ability to securely transmit this data to a remote entity. It may additionally store this data within the TOE boundary, in which case "the TOE itself" is selected and FAU_STG.2 must be included in the ST. Regardless of whether the TSF stores the audit data it generates within the TOE boundary, the TOE must always be able to securely transmit the audit data it generates to a remote entity. If audit data is generated by the platform, any secure local storage or secure remote transmission of this data is the responsibility of the platform.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>Although the audit server is outside of the TOE, the TSF should still be able to support 
                mutual authentication. There are no requirements levied on the audit server, but the TOE should be

                support verifying client certificates, the TSF is able to make use of that.</h:p>

In this case, the internal communication of audit data is protected via the mechanisms specified in FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER or FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT as appropriate. The intent of this requirement in the context of a distributed TOE is that all audit data generated by all components of the TSF be transmitted to an environmental entity entirely through trusted channels, regardless of whether it is transmitted directly from the TSF to the operational environment or whether it is first transmitted to another part of the TOE.</h:p>

              This SFR is only applicable if the TOE is distributed and therefore has multiple components that need to communicate via an internal 
		    TSF channel. When creating the TSF from the initial pair of components, either of these components may be identified as the 
		    TSF for the purposes of satisfying the meaning of "TSF" in this SFR.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The intention of this requirement is to ensure that there is a registration process that includes a positive enablement step by an administrator 
		    before components joining a distributed TOE can communicate with the other components of the TOE and before the new component can act as
		    part of the TSF. The registration process may itself involve communication with the joining component: many implementations use a bespoke
		    process for this, and the security requirements for the "registration communication" are then defined in
              <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>.
		    Use of this "registration communication" channel is not deemed inconsistent with the requirement of
              <xref to="fel-cpc"/>
              (i.e., the registration channel can be used before the enablement step, but only in order to complete the registration process).
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The channel selection (for the registration channel) in
              <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>
              is essentially a choice between the use of a normal 
		    secure channel that is equivalent to a channel used to communicate with external IT entities (FTP_ITC.1) or existing TOE components
		    (FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER and FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT), or else a separate type of channel that is specific to registration 
		    (FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_ENROLL or FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN). If the TOE does not require a communications channel for registration (e.g., because the registration is
		    achieved entirely by configuration actions by an administrator at each of the components) then the main selection in
              <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>
              is completed with the "No channel" option.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If the ST author selects the FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER and FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT channel type in the main selection in
              <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>
              then the TSS identifies the relevant SFR iteration that specifies the channel used. If the ST author
              selects the FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_ENROLL or FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN channel type, then the TSS (possibly 
              with support from the operational guidance) describes details of the channel and the mechanisms that it uses (and describes how the
              registration process ensures that the channel can only be used by the intended joiner and gatekeeper). Note that the FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_ENROLL or
              FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN channel type may require support from security measures in the operational environment (see the definition of

              Any security related information (such as keys, authentication data, and passwords) must be zeroized when no longer in use to prevent the disclosure 
			  or modification of security critical data.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The zeroization indicated above applies to each intermediate storage area for plaintext key and Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) (i.e., any storage, 
			  such as memory buffers, that is included in the path of such data) upon the transfer of the key or CSP to another location.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              Since the TOE does not include the host IT environment, the extent of this capability is necessarily somewhat limited. For the purposes of this
			  requirement, it is sufficient for the TOE to invoke the correct underlying functions of the host to perform the zeroization--it does not imply that 
			  the TOE has to include a kernel-mode memory driver to ensure the data are zeroized. It is  assumed that the host platform appropriately performs 
			  zeroization of key material in its internal processes.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              Several selections allow assignment of a "some value that does not contain any CSP." This means that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn 
			  from a source that may contain key material or reveal information about key material, and not being any of the particular values listed as other
			  selection options. The point of the phrase "does not contain any CSP" is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully selected, and not taken
			  from a general 'pool' that might contain current or residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.

                The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that if SHA-256 is selected, that it is being 
                  used only as a PRF or MAC step in a key derivation function or as part of LMS, and not as a hash algorithm.
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                If "invoke platform-provided functionality" is selected:
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it describes (for each 
			            supported platform) how the hash functionality is invoked for each digest size selected 
			            in the MDM server's ST (it should be noted that this may be through a mechanism that is not
			            implemented by the MDM server; nonetheless, that mechanism will be identified in the TSS as
			            part of this evaluation activity).
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                If "implement functionality" is selected:
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                The evaluator shall check that the association of the hash function with other
                  TSF cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature
                  verification function) is documented in the TSS. The evaluator shall
                  check the AGD documents to determine that any configuration that is required to be
                  done to configure the functionality for the required hash sizes is present. The
                  TSF hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes.
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                The first mode is the byte-oriented mode. In this mode the TSF
                  only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length (i.e., the
                  length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8).
                <h:br/>
                <h:br/>
                The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of
                  arbitrary length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given
                  in the following sections for the bit-oriented vs. byte-oriented TestMAC.

              This requirement captures all the configuration functionality in the MDM server to configure 
			the underlying MDM server. The ST author can add more commands and configuration policies by completing the assignment
			statement.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              Function b1 is selection-based under the very limited circumstances when certificate management is both 
              performed solely by platform-provided functionality and the platform uses cloud services; for all other
              instances it is mandatory. This requirement will be made fully mandatory again in a future version of 
              the PP. Function b1 can be met by relying on the platform to configure the certificates used by the MDM
              server, however, the MDM server must allow the administrator to choose which certificate is used for a 
              specific functionality. The selection in a corresponds to the selection in
              <xref to="fel-enr-limit"/>.
              The selection in b.2 includes a function that corresponds to the selection in
              <xref to="fel-x509-fail"/>.
              Function b.4 allows the administrator to configure
			        periodicity of assigned commands, for example "read audit logs kept by the MD." In this way the 
			        administrator can configure the MDM system to retrieve audit logs from the MD on a periodic, such as
			        daily, basis in order to ensure freshness of log data and to minimize loss of audit logs.
			        Function b.5 allows the
			        administrator to configure the privacy-sensitive information that will and will not be collected from particular
			        MDs to handle BYOD environments where some information may not be appropriate to collect. Privacy
			        sensitive information may include items such as device physical location and lists of installed personal
			        applications, and would vary depending on the particular capabilities of the TOE and MDM agent. The TOE should
			        provide the capability to group enrolled devices into categories such as enterprise-owned and personal-owned and 
			        define the information that will be collected from devices in each category. Function b.6 corresponds to 
			        configuring the length of time the user authenticator for enrollment is valid in FMT_SAE_EXT.1. This function
			        must be included in the ST if and only if FMT_SAE_EXT.1 is included in the ST.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              For distributed TOEs, the interaction between TOE components will be configurable (see FCO_CPC_EXT.1). Therefore,
			  the ST author includes the selection "Ability to configure the interaction between TOE components" for distributed 
			  TOEs. A simple example would be the change of communication protocol according to FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER. Another
			  example would be changing the management of a TOE component from direct remote administration to remote
			  administration through another TOE component. A more complex use case would be if the realization of an SFR is 
			  achieved through two or more TOE components and the responsibilities between the two or more components could 
			  be modified.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              For distributed TOEs, that implement a registration channel (as described in
              <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>), the ST
			  author uses the selection "configure the cryptographic functionality" in this SFR, and its corresponding mapping 
			  in the TSS, to describe the configuration of any cryptographic aspects of the registration channel that can be
			  modified by the operational environment in order to improve the channel security.

            </title>
            <note role="application">
              The intent of the mandatory portion of the above requirement is to use the cryptographic protocols identified in the requirement to establish and maintain a trusted channel between the TOE and the MDM agent. If the TOE includes a separate MAS Server, this requirement also addresses the communication between the MAS Server and the MDM agent.  Only TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS are used in this trusted channel.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              This requirement is to ensure that the transmission of any audit
              logs, MD information data (software version, hardware model, and
              application versions), and configuration data collected by the MDM
              agent and sent from the MDM agent to the MDM
              Server, when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly protected. This
              trusted channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the MDM server to the MDM agent. Either the 
              MDM agent or the MDM server is able to initiate the
              connection.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              For TLS connections between the MDM server and agent, the MDM server is the Server side of the TLS connection, 
              therefore it is appropriate to include the selection-based FCS_TLSS SFRs in the ST, not FCS_TLSC SFRs. With respect 
              to mutual authentication, in cases where the agent is outside of the TOE, it should be verified 
              that the server can support mutual authentication, meaning that the server includes support for client-side certificates 
              for TLS mutual authentication post-enrollment. However, the client side is not evaluated since the agent is not in 
              the TOE.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              This trusted channel protects the connection between an enrolled MDM agent and the MDM server. FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_ENROLL provides a trusted channel to protect the connection between an unenrolled MDM agent and the MDM server during the enrollment operation.

              The trusted channel uses TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS as the protocol that preserves the confidentiality and integrity of MDM communications. The ST author chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If the ST author selects "mutually authenticated TLS as defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security" or "mutually authenticated DTLS as defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security," the TSF must be validated against requirements from the Package for Transport Layer Security, with the following selections made:
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>
                  FCS_TLS_EXT.1:

                    <h:li>either TLS or DTLS is selected depending on the selection made in FTP_ITC.1.1/INTER_TSF_XFER_AGENT</h:li>
                    <h:li>server must be selected</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
                <h:li>
                  FCS_TLSS_EXT.1.1:
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>The cipher suites selected must correspond with the algorithms and hash functions allowed in FCS_COP.1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>mutual authentication must be selected</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
              </h:ul>
              Protocol, RBG, Certificate validation, algorithm, and similar services may be met with
              platform-provided services.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The requirement implies that not only are communications protected when they are initially established, 
              but also on resumption after an outage. It may be the case that some part of the TOE setup 
              involves manually setting up tunnels to protect other communication, and if after an outage the TOE 
              attempts to re-establish the communication automatically with (the necessary) manual intervention, there may be a 
              window created where an attacker might be able to gain critical information or compromise a connection.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              This requirement is claimed if "FTP_ITC.1/INTER_TSF_XFER_AGENT" is selected in
              FTP_ITC_EXT.1.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If HTTPS is chosen, FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1 must be included in the ST.

              that is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of its endpoints
              and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure.
            </title>
            <note role="application">
              The intent of the mandatory portion of the above requirement is to use the cryptographic 
              protocols identified in the requirement to establish and maintain a trusted channel with authorized IT entities 
              that the TOE interacts with to perform its functions.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              Protection (by one of the listed protocols) is required at least for communications with the server that collects 
              the audit information. If it communicates with an authentication server (e.g., RADIUS), then the ST 
              author chooses "authentication server" in FTP_ITC.1.1/INTER_XFER_IT and this connection must be protected 
              by one of the listed protocols. If other authorized IT entities (e.g., NTP server) are protected, the 
              ST author makes the appropriate assignments (for those entities) and selections (for the protocols 
              that are used to protect those connections).
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              To summarize, the connection to an external audit collection server is required to be protected by one of the listed 
              protocols. If an external authentication server is supported, then it is required to protect that connection with one 
              of the listed protocols. For any other external server, external communications are not required to be protected, but 
              if protection is claimed, then it must be protected with one of the identified protocols.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              For communications with any authorized IT entities outside of the TOE, the MDM server should still 
              be able to support mutual authentication. There are no requirements levied on the external entities, but the MDM server 
              should be able to support mutual authentication. This way if the non-TOE authorized 
              entity does support mutual authentication, the MDM server is in a position to make use of that.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The trusted channel uses IPsec, TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS as the protocol that preserves the confidentiality and integrity of MDM communications. The ST 
			  author chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If "IPsec as defined in the PP-Module for VPN Client" is selected, the TSF must claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the VPN Client 
			  PP-Module.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If HTTPS is chosen, FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1 must be included in the ST.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If the ST author selects "SSH as defined in the Functional Package for Secure Shell," the TSF must be validated against the FP for Secure Shell with 
			  the MDM PP. It should be noted that due to constraints imposed by this PP that SHA-1 cannot be used.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If the ST author selects "mutually authenticated TLS as defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security" or "mutually authenticated DTLS as 
			  defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security," the TSF must be validated against requirements from the Package for Transport Layer Security,
			  with the following selections made:
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>
                  FCS_TLS_EXT.1:
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>either TLS or DTLS is selected depending on the selection made in FTP_ITC.1.1/INTER_XFER_IT</h:li>
                    <h:li>either client or server is selected as appropriate</h:li>

                </h:li>
              </h:ul>
              Protocol, RBG, Certificate validation, algorithm, and similar services may be met with
              platform-provided 
              services.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The requirement implies that not only are communications protected when they are initially established, but 
              also on resumption after an outage. It may be the case that some part of the TOE setup involves 
              manually setting up tunnels to protect other communication, and if after an outage the TOE attempts 
              to re-establish the communication automatically with (the necessary) manual intervention, there may be a window created 
              where an attacker might be able to gain critical information or compromise a connection.

              This SFR describes the communication channels between the MDM server and an agent that may or may not be in the TOE, and optionally separate

              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              If the TOE includes an MDM agent, then the communication channel between the agent and TSF is internal to the TOE and thus "an MDM agent that is
              internal to the TOE" must be selected in the first selection. Additionally FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT must be selected in the second selection and
              FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT must be included in the ST.

              <h:br/>
              If the TOE interoperates with an evaluated MDM agent built into a MD (i.e., the TOE does not include an MDM agent), the communication channel 
              between the agent and TSF is external to the TOE and thus "an MDM agent that is external to the TOE" must be selected in the first selection.
              Additionally FTP_ITC.1/INTER_TSF_XFER_AGENT must be selected in the second selection and FTP_ITC.1/INTER_TSF_XFER_AGENT must be included in the ST.

              <h:br/>
              If "other components comprising the distributed TOE" is selected in the first selection then FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER must be selected in the second
              selection. FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER must be included in the ST for all internal channels used to transfer TSF data between TOE components other than an

              This SFR implements one of the types of channel identified in the main selection for
              <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>. The "joining component" in FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN is the IT entity that is attempting to join the distributed TOE by using the registration process.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The effect of this SFR is to require the ability for components to communicate in a secure manner while the distributed TSF is being created (or when adding components to an existing distributed TSF). When creating the TSF from the initial pair of components, either of these components may be identified as the TSF for the purposes of satisfying the meaning of "TSF" in this SFR.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The selection at the end of FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN recognises that in some cases confidentiality (i.e., protection of the data from disclosure) may not be provided by the channel. The ST author distinguishes in the TSS whether in this case the TOE relies on the environment to provide confidentiality (as part of the constraints referenced in
              <xref to="fel-trp-func-tsf"/>) or whether the registration data exchanged does not require confidentiality (in which case this assertion must be justified). If "none" is selected, then this word may be omitted in the ST to improve readability.

              The assignment in
              <xref to="fel-trp-func-tsf"/>
              ensures that the ST highlights any specific details needed to protect the registration environment. Note that when the ST uses FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN for the registration channel then this channel cannot be reused as the normal inter-component communication channel (the latter channel must meet FTP_ITC.1 or FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER / FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT). Specific requirements for Preparative Procedures relating to FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN are defined in the Evaluation Activities.

      The Security Objectives for the TOE in
      <xref to="req"/>
      were constructed to address threats
      identified in
      <xref to="Threats"/>. The Security 
	Functional Requirements (SFRs) in
      <xref to="req"/>
      are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP identifies the Security Assurance
	Requirements (SARs) to frame the extent to which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs independent testing.
      <h:br/>
      This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3 that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Evaluation
	Activities (AAs) to be performed are specified both in
      <xref to="req"/>
      as well as in this section.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF will obtain the TOE, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative and user guides for the TOE. 
	The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Evaluation 
	Activities contained within
      <xref to="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the
	specific technology instantiated in the TOE. The Evaluation Activities that are captured in
      <xref to="req"/>
      also provide clarification as to what the
	developer needs to provide to demonstrate the TOE is compliant with the PP.

        Testing is specified for functional aspects of the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses. The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the following requirements.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        Since many of the APIs are not exposed at the user interface (e.g., touch screen), the ability to stimulate the necessary interfaces requires a developer's test environment. This test environment will allow the evaluator, for example, to access APIs and view file system information that is not available on consumer devices.
        <a-component cc-id="ate_ind.1" name="Independent Testing - Conformance (ATE_IND.1)">
          Testing is performed to confirm the functionality described in the TSS as well as the administrative (including configuration and operational) documentation provided. The focus of the testing is to confirm that the requirements specified in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 are being met, although some additional testing is specified for SARs in Section 6. The Evaluation Activities identify the additional testing activities associated with these components. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the TOE or platform combinations that are claiming conformance to this PP.

              The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing aspects of the system. The
			  test plan covers all of the testing
			  actions contained in the CEM and the body of this PP's Evaluation Activities. While it is not
			  necessary to have
			  one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the evaluator must document in the test plan that each 
			  applicable testing requirement in the ST is covered.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The test plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but
				included in the ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the platforms. This justification
				must address the differences between the tested platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that
				the differences do not affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
				differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are tested, then
				no rationale is necessary.
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary beyond
				what is contained in the  part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test
				drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) should be provided that the 
				driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the TOE and its platform.
				This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms 
				implemented by this engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being
				evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH).
              <h:br/>
              <h:br/>
              The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve 
				those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could just be an annotated 
				version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and
				includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that
				resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a
				"fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting details), and not just the "pass" result.

	and complexity of evaluation. This approach is permitted by [CC] Part 1, 8.2 Dependencies between
	components.<h:br/><h:br/>
	This information benefits systems engineering activities which call for inclusion of particular security

        </h:td>
        <h:td>
          FIA_UAU.1 has a dependency on FIA_UID.1 because authentication of an external entity requires that entity to first identify
          itself so that its identity can be validated by the authentication process.
          <h:br/>
          <h:br/>
          This SFR has not been defined in this PP-Module because authentication of a user implicitly requires them to be identified as well.
          <h:br/>
          <h:br/>
          There are two cases in which a user must be authenticated by the TSF per the application note in FIA_UAU.1: enrollment of a user’s 
          MD into management, and authentication of a user to the TOE’s management interface. FIA_ENR_EXT.1 requires authentication
          of the user using a method such as a directory server, which implicitly expects that the user must identify themselves as well as 
          provide a credential associated with the claimed identity. For management, FMT_SMR.1(1) requires the TSF to maintain an administrator
          role but it does not specify whether authentication to this role is role-based or identity-based. Therefore, the PP is not concerned 
          with the specific mechanism by which an administrator presents their identity to the TSF, only that there is a mechanism to validate
          and authorize whatever information they do present.

        </h:td>
        <h:td>
          FAU_SEL.1 has a dependency on FMT_MTD.1 because the configuration settings that determine what events are audited is considered to be
          TSF data. While FAU_SEL.1 determines the extent to which the TOE’s audit function is configured, it relies on FMT_MTD.1 to determine
          the administrative roles that are permitted to manipulate this data.
          <h:br/>
          <h:br/>
          The PP allows FAU_SEL.1 to be implemented either by the TSF or by the TOE platform because the TOE may rely on the audit functionality
          provided by the OS it runs on. If this is configured entirely through the platform, the administrator does not necessarily need to be 
          authenticated by the TOE to do this. Therefore, requiring FMT_MTD.1 does not make sense in this situation. If this is configured through
          the TOE, it can be implied from a review of FMT_SMR.1(1) that the ‘MD user’ role cannot perform this function as they lack the authority
          to manage the TSF. It is therefore understood that this function can be performed by the ‘administrator’ role or potentially by one or 
          more roles specified by the ST author if the selection to specify additional roles is chosen. An additional SFR that explicitly identifies
          the roles permitted to manage this function is redundant in this context.

          accurate timestamps as well as some cryptographic operations, such as determining if a presented X.509 certificate is expired. The TOE 
          is installed on a general-purpose computer or specialized network device that is assumed to have the ability to provide certain functions

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix">
    This appendix describes the required supplementary information for each entropy source used by the TOE.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    The 
	documentation of the entropy sources should be detailed enough that, after reading, the evaluator will thoroughly 
	understand the entropy source and why it can be relied on to provide sufficient entropy. This documentation should 
	include multiple detailed sections: design description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. 
	This documentation is not required to be part of the TSS.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    <section id="design-description" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source
	as a whole, including the interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
	design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the product.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The
	documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include, how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed 
	(raw) data can be obtained from within the entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the
	entropy source design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any post-processing 
	of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if or where it is stored, and finally, how it is output from the entropy source. Any 
	conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking) should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and
	examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary 
	of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary outside the boundary cannot 
	affect the entropy rate.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      If implemented, the design description shall include a description of how third-party
	applications can add entropy to the RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be 
	included.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
    </section>
    <section id="entropy-justification" title="Entropy Justification">
      There should be a technical argument for where
      the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the entropy
      source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this particular
        TOE). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e., the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This
      discussion will be part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied on to
      produce bits with entropy.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The amount of information necessary to justify the
      expected min-entropy rate depends on the type of entropy source included in the
      product.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      For developer provided entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy
      rate, it is expected that a large number of raw source bits will be collected, statistical
      tests will be performed, and the min-entropy rate determined from the statistical tests.
      While no particular statistical tests are required at this time, it is expected that some
      testing is necessary in order to determine the amount of min-entropy in each output.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE vendor has
      limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation will
      indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source. It
      is acceptable for the vendor to "assume" an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption
      must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate
      must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Regardless
      of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized
      with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the
      min-entropy rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the
      rate of entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared
      to the statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or
      the calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The entropy justification shall not include any data added from
      any third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
    </section>
    <section id="operating-conditions" title="Operating Conditions">
      The entropy rate may be affected by conditions
      outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency,
      temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the
      operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of
      operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data.
      Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no
      longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation
      of the source shall be included.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
    </section>
    <section id="sec4" title="Health Testing">
      More specifically, all entropy source health tests
      and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
      the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE
      behavior upon entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be
      appropriate for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source.

	requirements will transition from objective requirements to baseline requirements in future versions of this PP.

  <appendix title="Evaluating Additional Components for a Distributed TOE" id="EACDT">
    In the case of a distributed TOE the ST will identify an evaluated configuration that consists of a number of separate components chosen by the ST author, 
	which collectively satisfy the requirements of the PP. This evaluated configuration need not be the minimum set of components that could possibly meet the PP 
	(e.g., if the TOE is intended for large enterprise deployments then the evaluated configuration might include some redundancy in components in order to support
	expected connectivity and loads), but because this is the main configuration referred to in the ST and the evaluation, it is treated in this section as the 
	minimum configuration of interest and is referred to here as the 'minimum configuration' as well as the 'evaluated configuration'.
    <h:br/>
    <h:br/>
    In addition to the minimum configuration above, the ST may also identify (at the author's discretion, and subject to verification as described in this section) 
	which TOE components can have instances added to an operational configuration without affecting the validity of the CC certification. The ST description may 
	include constraints on how such components are added, including required or prohibited configurations of the components.

	  channels used by the extra component for intra-TOE communications (FPT_ITT) and external communications (FTP_ITC) must be consistent, the audit information
	  generated by the extra component must be maintained, and the management of the extra component must be consistent with that used for the original instance of

      If the description of the use of extra components in the ST and guidance documentation identifies any difference in the SFRs allocated to a component, or

	  that were not included in the minimum configuration.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>

      <h:br/>
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Communications: the evaluator follows the guidance documentation to confirm, by testing, that any additional connections introduced with the extra 
		component and not present in the minimum configuration are consistent with the requirements stated in the ST (e.g., with regard to protocols and ciphersuites
		used). An example of such an additional connection would be if a single instance of the component is present in the minimum configuration and adding a 
		duplicate component then introduces an extra communication between the two instances. Another example might be if the use of the additional components

  <appendix title="MDM Software Equivalency Guidelines" id="equiv">
    <section id="mdm-intro" title="Introduction">
      The purpose of equivalence in PP-based evaluations is to find a balance between evaluation rigor and commercial practicability, to 
      ensure that evaluations meet customer expectations while recognizing that there is little to be gained from requiring that every 
      variation in a product or platform be fully tested. If a product is found to be compliant with a PP on one platform, then all 
      equivalent products on equivalent platforms are also considered to be compliant with the PP.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      A Vendor can make a claim of equivalence if the Vendor believes that a particular instance of their Product implements PP-specified 
      security functionality in a way equivalent to the implementation of the same functionality on another instance of their Product on 
      which the functionality was tested. The Product instances can differ in version number or feature level (model), or the instances may
      run on different platforms. Equivalency can be used to reduce the testing required across claimed evaluated configurations. It can 
      also be used during Assurance Maintenance to reduce testing needed to add more evaluated configurations to a certification.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      These equivalency guidelines do not replace Assurance Maintenance requirements or NIAP Policy #5 requirements for CAVP certificates. 
      Nor may equivalency be used to leverage evaluations with expired certifications.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      These Equivalency Guidelines represent a shift from complete testing of all product instances to more of a risk-based approach. 
      Rather than require that every combination of product and platform be tested, these guidelines support an approach that recognizes
      that products are being used in a variety of environments, and often in cloud environments over where the vendor (and sometimes the 
      customer) have little or no control over the underlying hardware. Developers should be responsible for the security functionality of 
      their applications on the platforms they are developed for, whether that is an operating system, a virtual machine, or a software-based
      execution environment such as a container. But those platforms may themselves run within other environments, virtual machines or
      operating systems, that completely abstract away the underlying hardware from the application. The developer should not be held
      accountable for security functionality that is implemented by platform layers that are abstracted away. The implication is that
      not all security functionality will necessarily be tested for all platform layers down to the hardware for all evaluated
      configurations, especially for applications developed for software-based execution environments such as containers. For these cases, 
      the balancing of evaluation rigor and commercial practicability tips in favor of practicability. Note that this does not affect the requirement 
	  that at least one product instance be fully tested on at least one platform with cryptography mapped to a CAVP certificate.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Equivalency has two aspects:
      <h:br/>
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>
          <h:b>
            <h:i>Product Equivalence:</h:i>
          </h:b>
          Products may be considered equivalent if there are no
          differences between Product Models and Product Versions with respect to PP-specified security functionality.
        </h:li>
        <h:li>
          <h:b>
            <h:i>Platform Equivalence:</h:i>
          </h:b>
          Platforms may be considered equivalent if there are no
          significant differences in the services they provide to the Product, or in the way the platforms 
          provide those services, with respect to PP-specified security functionality.
        </h:li>
      </h:ul>
      The equivalency determination is made in accordance with these guidelines by the Validator and Scheme using information provided by the evaluator or vendor.
    </section>
    <section id="approach" title="Approach to Equivalency Analysis">
      There are two scenarios for performing equivalency analysis. One is when a product has been certified and the vendor 
      wants to show that a later product should be considered certified due to equivalence with the earlier product. The 
      other is when multiple product variants are going though evaluation together and the vendor would like to reduce 
      the amount of testing that must be done. The basic rules for determining equivalence are the same in both cases. 
      But there is one additional consideration that applies to equivalence with previously certified products. That is, 
      the product with which equivalence is being claimed must have a valid certification in accordance with scheme rules
      and the Assurance Maintenance process must be followed. If a product’s certification has expired, then equivalence 
      cannot be claimed with that product.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      When performing equivalency analysis, the evaluator or vendor should first use the factors and guidelines for Product
      Model equivalence to determine the set of Product Models to be evaluated. In general, Product Models that do not differ 
      in PP-specified security functionality are considered equivalent for purposes of evaluation against the APP PP.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      If multiple revision levels of Product Models are to be evaluated, or to determine whether a revision of an evaluated 
      product needs re-evaluation, the evaluator or vendor and validator should use the factors and guidelines for Product 
      Version equivalence to analyze whether Product Versions are equivalent.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Having determined the set of Product Models and Versions to be evaluated, the next step is to determine the set of
      Platforms that the Products must be tested on.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Each non-equivalent Product for which compliance is claimed must be fully tested on each non-equivalent platform 
      for which compliance is claimed. For non-equivalent Products on equivalent platforms, only the differences that
      affect PP-specified security functionality must be tested for each product.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <h:b>
        <h:i>"Differences in PP-Specified Security Functionality" Defined</h:i>
      </h:b>
      <h:br/>
      If PP-specified security functionality is implemented by the TOE, then differences in the actual implementation
      between versions or product models break equivalence for that feature. Likewise, if the TOE implements the 
      functionality in one version or model and the functionality is implemented by the platform in another version 
      or model, then equivalence is broken. If the functionality is implemented by the platform in multiple models or 
      versions on equivalent platforms, then the functionality is considered different if the product invokes the platform 
      differently to perform the function.
    </section>
    <section id="modelequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Product Model Equivalence">
      Product Model equivalence attempts to determine whether different feature levels of the same product across 
      a product line are equivalent for purposes of PP testing. For example, if a product has a "basic" edition and an "enterprise" 
      edition, is it necessary to test both models? Or does testing one model provide sufficient assurance that both models 
      are compliant?
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Product models are considered equivalent if there are no differences that affect PP-specified security functionality, as indicated in

    <section id="platformequiv" title="Specific Guidance for Determining Platform Equivalence">
      Platform equivalence is used to determine the platforms that equivalent versions of a Product must be tested on. 
      Platform equivalence analysis done for one MDM cannot be applied to another MDM.
      Platform equivalence is not general, it is with respect to a particular MDM.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Product Equivalency analysis must already have been done and Products have been determined to be equivalent.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The platform can be hardware or virtual hardware, an operating system or similar entity, or a software execution 
      environment such as a container. For purposes of determining equivalence for MDMs, we address each
      type of platform separately. In general, platform equivalence is based on differences in the interfaces between the 
      TOE and Platform that are relevant to the implementation of PP-specified security functionality.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <section id="hardware-equiv" title="Platform Equivalence, Hardware and Virtual Hardware Platforms">
        If an MDM runs directly on hardware without an operating system, or directly on virtualized 
        hardware without an operating system, then platform equivalence is based on processor architecture and 
        instruction sets. In the case of virtualized hardware, it is the virtualized processor and architecture 
        that are presented to the MDM that matters, not the physical hardware.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        Platforms with different processor architectures and instruction sets are not equivalent. This is not 
        likely to be an issue for equivalency analysis for MDMs since there is likely to be a different 
        version of the MDM for different hardware environments.
        Equivalency analysis becomes important when comparing processors with the same architecture. Processors 
        with the same architecture that have instruction sets that are subsets or supersets of each other are not
        disqualified from being equivalent for purposes of an MDM evaluation. If the MDM takes the same 
        code paths when executing PP-specified security functionality on different processors of the same family, 
        then the processors can be considered equivalent with respect to that MDM.
        For example, if an MDM follows one code path on platforms that support the AES-NI instruction 
        and another on platforms that do not, then those two platforms are not equivalent with respect to that 
        MDM functionality. But if the MDM follows the same code path whether or not the platform 
        supports AES-NI, then the platforms are equivalent with respect to that functionality.
        <h:br/>
        <h:br/>
        The platforms are equivalent with respect to the MDM if the platforms are equivalent with respect to all PP-specified
        security functionality.

      In order to make equivalency determinations, the vendor and evaluator must agree on the equivalency claims. They must

      TOE instances and platforms that are claimed to be equivalent.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The ST must describe all configurations evaluated down to processor manufacturer, model number, and microarchitecture version.

      must describe the differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE functions

      differences in the TOE with respect to PP-specified security functionality and how the TOE functions differently to leverage
      platform differences in the tested configuration versus the claimed equivalent configuration. Relevant platform differences

  <section title="Introduction to Distributed TOEs" id="idt">
    This PP includes support for distributed MDM TOEs. MDMs can sometimes be composed of multiple components operating as a logical whole. Frequently we
		see this architecture when dealing with products hosted in the cloud and offered as Software as a Service. There are a number of different
		architectures; but fundamentally, they are variations of the following model where the SFRs of this PP can only be fulfilled if the components 
		are deployed and operate together. To be considered a distributed TOE, a minimum of two interconnected components are required.
    <section title="Registration of Distributed TOE Components" id="rcd">
      When dealing with a distributed TOE, a number of separate components need to be brought together in the operational environment in order to create the TOE.
			This requires that trusted communications channels are set up between certain pairs of components (it is assumed that all components need to
			communicate with at least one other component, but not that all components need to communicate with all other components). The underlying model for
			creation of the TOE is to have a "registration process" in which components "join" the TOE. The registration
			process starts with two components, one of which (the "joiner") is about to join an existing TOE by registering with the other
			(the "gatekeeper"). The two components will use one or more specified authentication and communication channel options so that the components
			authenticate each other and protect any sensitive data that is transmitted during the registration process (e.g., a key might be sent by a gatekeeper 
			to the joiner as a result of the registration). The following figures illustrate the three supported registration models.
      <xref to="DTF1"/>
      illustrates a
			distributed TOE registration approach which uses an instance of FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER / FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT or
			FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT to protect the registration exchange.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig1.png" pre="Figure " title="Distributed TOE registration using channel satisfying FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER / FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT or FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT" id="DTF1"/>
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The second approach (<xref to="DTF2"/>) uses an alternative registration channel and supports use cases where the channel relies on environmental security
			constraints to provide the necessary protection of the registration exchange.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig2.png" pre="Figure " title="Distributed TOE registration using channel satisfying FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN" id="DTF2"/>
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      The final approach (<xref to="DTF3"/>) supports use cases where registration is performed manually through direct configuration of both the Joiner and Gatekeeper 
			devices. Once configured, the two components establish an internal TSF channel that satisfies
			FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER / FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT or FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig3.png" pre="Figure " title="Distributed TOE registration without a registration channel" id="DTF3"/>
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      In each case, during the registration process, the administrator must positively enable the joining components before it can act as part of the TSF.
      <xref to="DTF4"/>
      illustrates the approaches that this enablement step may take;
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <figure entity="images/DistributedToeFig4.png" pre="Figure " title="Joiner enablement options for Distributed TOEs" id="DTF4"/>
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Note that in the case where no registration channel is required, that is the joiner and gatekeeper are directly configured (<xref to="DTF3"/>), enablement is
			implied as part of this direct configuration process.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      After registration, the components will communicate between themselves using a normal SSH, TLS, DTLS, IPsec, or HTTPS channel (which is specified in an ST as 
			an instance of FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER / FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT or FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT in
			terms of
      <xref to="req"/>
      and
      <xref g="t-audit-optional"/>). This channel for
			inter-component communications is specified at the top level with the new (extended) SFR FCO_CPC_EXT.1 and is in addition to the other communication 
			channels required for communication with entities outside the TOE (which are specified in an ST as instances of FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT and 
			FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_REM_ADMIN.
    </section>
    <section title="Allocation of Requirements in Distributed TOEs" id="ard">
      For a distributed TOE, the security functional requirements in this PP need to be met by the TOE as a whole, but not all SFRs will necessarily be 
			implemented by all components. The following categories are defined in order to specify when each SFR must be implemented by a component:
      <h:br/>
      <h:ul>
        <h:li><h:b>All Components ("All")</h:b> - All components that comprise the distributed TOE must independently satisfy the requirement.</h:li>
        <h:li><h:b>At least one Component ("One")</h:b> - This requirement must be fulfilled by at least one component within the distributed TOE.</h:li>
        <h:li>
          <h:b>Feature Dependent ("Feature Dependent")</h:b>
          - These requirements will only be fulfilled where the feature is implemented by the
				distributed TOE component (note that the requirement to meet the PP as a whole requires that at least one component implements these
				requirements if they are specified in
          <xref to="req"/>).
        </h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <xref to="distTOE"/>
      specifies how each of the SFRs in this PP must be met, using the categories above.

      Only those SFRs included in the ST are required to be audited. The ST for a distributed TOE must include a mapping of SFRs to each of the components 
			of the TOE. (Note that this deliverable is examined as part of the ASE_TSS.1 and AVA_VAN.1 Evaluation Activities.) The ST for a distributed TOE 
			may also introduce a "minimum configuration" and identify components that may have instances added to an operational configuration without affecting 
			the validity of the CC certification. Appendix E describes Evaluation Activities relating to these equivalency aspects of a distributed TOE (and
			hence what is expected in the ST).

    <section title="Security Audit for Distributed TOEs" id="dis">
      <h:br/>
      For distributed TOEs, the handling of audit information might be more complicated than for TOEs consisting only of one component.
			There are a few basic requirements to be fulfilled:
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Every component must be able to generate audit information.</h:li>
        <h:li>Every component must be able to buffer audit information and forward it to another TOE component or an external audit server. Optionally,
			each component may store audit information locally.</h:li>
        <h:li>For the overall TOE it must be possible to send out audit information to an external audit server.</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <h:br/>
      In general, every component must be able to generate its own audit information. It would be possible that every component also stores its own audit 
	      information locally as well as every component could be able to send out audit data to an external audit server. It would also be sufficient that
	      every component would be able to generate its own audit data and buffer it locally before the information is sent out to one or more other 
	      TOE components for local storage or transmission to an external audit server. For the transfer of audit records between TOE components 
	      the secure connection via FTP_ITC.1/INTER_XFER_IT or FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER / FPT_ITT.1/INTER_XFER_AGENT  must be used.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Such a solution would still be suitable to fulfill the requirement that all audit-related SFRs have to be fulfilled by all TOE components,
	      although formally not every component would support local storage or transfer to an external audit server itself.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      Regarding the establishment of inter-TOE communication, error conditions as well as successful connection and tear-down events should be captured
	      by both ends of the connection.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      All TOE components shall be able to generate its own audit data according to FAU_GEN.1 for all SFRs that it implements. For distributed 
	      TOEs, a mapping shall be provided to show which auditable events according to FAU_GEN.1 are covered by which components (also giving a
	      justification that the records generated by each component cover all the SFRs that it implements). The overall TOE has to provide audit 
	      information about all events defined for FAU_GEN.1. As a result, at least one TOE component has to be assigned to every auditable event
	      defined for FAU_GEN.1. The part of the mapping related to
      <xref g="t-audit-mandatory"/>
      shall be consistent with the mapping of SFRs to 
	      TOE components for ASE_TSS.1 in the sense that all components defined as generating audit information for a particular SFR should also contribute 
	      to that SFR in the mapping for ASE_TSS.1. This applies not only to audit events defined for mandatory SFRs but also to all audit events for 
	      optional, selection-based, and objective SFRs as defined in
      <xref g="t-audit-optional"/>,
      <xref g="t-audit-objective"/>, and
      <xref g="t-audit-sel-based"/>.
      <h:br/>
      <h:br/>
      If one or more of the optional audit components FAU_STG.1 or FAU_STG.2 are selected in the ST derived from this PP, then the SFR
	      mapping for ASE_TSS.1 must include a specific identification of the TOE components to which they apply.
