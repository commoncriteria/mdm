                            The tests for the extendedKeyUsage rules are performed in conjunction with the uses that

                            those rules. The evaluator shall create a chain of at least three certificates: the node
                            certificate to be tested, an Intermediate CA, and the self-signed Root CA.

                                <test>The evaluator shall load a certificate or certificates as trusted CAs needed to

                                    should be revoked by the root CA). The evaluator shall ensure that a valid

                                    ensure when the certificate is no longer valid that the validation function fails.
